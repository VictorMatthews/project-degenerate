# ProjectDegenerate

D&amp;D Weapon Generator

This is a weapon generator for any game master looking for some magical loot

## How to run this app

First to run this app you will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (unless you download the [zip](https://github.com/VictorMatthews/project-degenerate/archive/master.zip) from GitHub) 

Clone this repo with git by running `git clone https://github.com/VictorMatthews/project-degenerate.git`

Open that directory in your terminal and run `npm install` followed by `npm serve`

From there all you have to do is open a browser and navigate to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/)

This app was designed for mobile and looks best in a skinny browser. Just click the add button and watch new weapons get generated
